      'It is free to study, but the place itself, and the building, along with its facilities are all financed by private investors. Here you can study A levels, and then continue your College at the very same Institute, as you can also study two different higher education degrees. Thus, if you study a carrer here at IAE you will finally become a Cybersecurity Technician or Computer Technician.',
